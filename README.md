# Purpose
This Project aims to develop an classifier that can classify Archaeological artifacts based on images.Potentially such techniques  can help archaeologist in their assessment and classification of archaeological finds

# Method
The model is trained on Convulational Neural Network using VGG19 transfer learning plus the custom output layer on three different categories namely Basket, Coin and Figure 

# Dataset
The Dataset has been taken from sources like kaggle, http://collection-online.moa.ubc.ca/explore and contains 1000 images per class in trainig data and 100 images per class in validation data

# Model Performance 
This is the final model that yielded the highest accuracy:
